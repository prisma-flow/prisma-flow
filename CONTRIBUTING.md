## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. We follow the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20
- npm ≥ 10
- A local Postgres instance, SQLite fixture, or Docker for integration testing

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitHackerz/prisma-flow.git
cd prisma-flow
npm install           # installs all workspace packages + sets up Husky hooks
```

Copy the example env file and fill in a test `DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Verify everything works

```bash
npm run typecheck     # zero TypeScript errors expected
npm test              # all tests should pass
npm run lint          # Biome lint and formatting checks
npm run security:audit # high-severity production dependency audit
npm run build         # full build should succeed
```

## Development Workflow

```
main          ← default branch and release source
feature/xxx   ← feature branches created from main
fix/xxx       ← bug fix branches created from main
```

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes — keep PRs focused on a single concern.
3. Add or update tests to cover your change.
4. Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` — all must pass locally.
5. Open a Pull Request targeting `main`.

## Commit Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): short description

Body (optional) — explain *why*, not just *what*.

Closes #42
```

| Type       | When to use                                             |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New feature                                             |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                                 |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                                      |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                |
| `chore`    | Tooling, dependencies, CI                               |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                 |

Use this convention for commits and pull request titles.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Title** — write a clear, conventional commit-style title.
2. **Description** — include context, motivation, and a summary of changes.
3. **Screenshots** — include before/after screenshots for UI changes.
4. **Checklist** before requesting review:
   - [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes
   - [ ] `npm run lint` passes
   - [ ] `npm test` passes
   - [ ] `npm run format:check` passes (run `npm run format` to auto-fix)
   - [ ] `npm run security:audit` passes or any advisory is explained
   - [ ] New/changed behaviour is documented
   - [ ] No unrelated files changed

PRs are merged by squash-and-merge to keep a clean history on `main`.

## Testing

| Package              | Command                                   | What it runs                    |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `packages/cli`       | `npm test --workspace=packages/cli`       | Vitest unit + integration tests |
| `packages/dashboard` | `npm test --workspace=packages/dashboard` | Vitest + React Testing Library  |
| All                  | `npm test`                                | All workspaces via Turborepo    |

Tests live alongside source in `src/tests/` (CLI) and `app/components/*.test.tsx`
(dashboard).

When adding a new core module, add a corresponding `*.test.ts` file.
When adding a new API route, add integration coverage in `server.test.ts`.

## Releasing

Releases are automated with Release Please. Conventional Commits pushed to
`main` update a single bot-authored release PR. That PR keeps the CLI and shared
package versions synchronized, updates their workspace dependency and lockfile,
then runs Biome formatting and lint checks before it is ready for review.

Merging the generated release PR runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
reruns the production gate, publishes any missing package versions to npm, and
creates the matching GitHub release and tag. Ordinary pushes to `main` never
publish npm packages.

Before the first public release:

1. Create or claim the `@prisma-flow` npm organization.
2. Add an npm automation token as the GitHub Actions secret `NPM_TOKEN`.
3. Confirm private vulnerability reporting is enabled in GitHub repository
   settings.
4. Confirm both package names are available:

```bash
npm view prisma-flow version
npm view @prisma-flow/shared version
```

Before every release PR is merged:

```bash
npm run verify:release
```

Use Conventional Commits to choose the automatic bump: `fix:` produces a patch,
`feat:` produces a minor release, and `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` produces a
major release. Review and merge the Release Please PR when ready. The repository
must have an npm automation token with publish access stored as the `NPM_TOKEN`
GitHub Actions secret.

After CI publishes, test from a fresh Prisma project:

```bash
npx prisma-flow@latest --help
npx prisma-flow@latest doctor
```

For a one-time manual first publish, do not pass `--provenance` from a local
terminal. npm provenance is generated from supported CI/OIDC providers, not from
ordinary local shells. If npm requires two-factor authentication, pass a current
OTP code directly to each publish command:

```bash
npm publish --workspace=packages/shared --access public --otp=<code>
npm publish --workspace=packages/cli --otp=<code>
```
